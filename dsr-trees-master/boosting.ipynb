    "## Trees: Ensemble Methods - Boosting\n",
    "\n",
    "Boosting is another ensemble technique to create a collection of predictors. In this technique, learners are learned sequentially with early learners fitting simple models to the data and then analyzing data for errors. In other words, we fit consecutive trees (random sample) at every step,and the goal is to solve for net error from the prior tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "When an input is misclassified by a hypothesis, its weight is increased so that next hypothesis is more likely to classify it correctly. By combining the whole set at the end converts weak learners into a better performing model.\n",
    "\n",
    "An ensemble of trees are built one by one and individual trees are summed sequentially. The Next tree tries to recover the loss (difference between actual and predicted values) from the previous tree.\n",

    "#### Adaboost = Adaptive Boosting\n",
    "AdaBoost learns from the mistakes by increasing the weight of misclassified data points.\n",

    "*Adaboost usually has just a node and two leaves.(A tree with one node and two leaves is called a stump)*\n",

    "Steps:\n",
    "<li> 0: Initialize the weights of data points. (e.g. data has 1000 points, each initial point would have 1/1000 = 0.001) </li>\n",
    "<li> 1: Train a decision Tree (whole dataset) </li>\n",
    "<li> 2: Calculate the weighted error rate (e) of the decision tree. </li>\n",
    "<li> 3: Calculate this decision tree’s weight in the ensemble. The weight of this tree = learning rate * log( (1 — e) / e) </li> \n",
    "<br> ** The higher the weighted error of the tree, the less decision power the tree will be given during the later voting. </br>\n",
