# Fundamentals of Machine Learning Course at DSR

## Local Environment

To have these notebooks running locally, you need to follow these steps:

1) Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/dvgodoy/ML_Fundamentals.git`
2) Inside the folder of the clone repo, create a conda environment: `conda env create -f environment.yml -n fund`
3) Activate the virtual environment: `conda activate fund`
4) Run Jupyter: `jupyter notebook`

Obs.: environment.yml is conda's equivalent of requirements.txt
Obs.: you need to have [GraphViz](https://www.graphviz.org/) installed as well 

## Binder

You can use [Binder](https://mybinder.org/) to open the notebooks on an executable environment - just click on the badge: [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/dvgodoy/ML_Fundamentals/master)

After it starts, it will open a familiar ***Jupyter notebook interface***! Just run ***all cells***, wait for the ***interactive plots*** to load and you're good to go!
